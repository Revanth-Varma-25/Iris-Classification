# Machine Learning Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for classification tasks, focusing on:
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation
- Feature selection
- Cross-validation

We explore different classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Grid Search and Random Search. Models are evaluated using cross-validation, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for detailed analysis and experimentation.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: The final saved best model after optimization.

## Requirements
To install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
